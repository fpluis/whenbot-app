# whenbot

Chatbot that uses WhenHub's API to manage your schedules. Entry into the WhenHub Hackathon, "Best use of WhenHub API" category. 

## Usage 

Try it at https://studio.whenhub.com/signin/?redirect_url=https://rtomrud.github.io/whenbot-app/. After logging in, use the chat input to type or speak using the microphone, and WhenBot will carry out your orders. By asking for help, it will read the list of available actions.

## What is it?

The WhenBot allows users to add, see, edit or delete their WhenHub schedules and events. Additionally, users can "timeshift" a schedule, moving its events in time any arbitrary time amount, or to any particular date.

All the interaction is performed using natural language, and although there is a chat interface, it is designed so that users can speak to it and listen without having to look at the screen. This makes it ideal for situations where the user cannot use a computer screen, but still wants to quickly check or change schedules or events.
