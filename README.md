# whenbot
Chatbot that uses WhenHub's API to manage your schedules. Entry into the Whenhub hackathon, backend category. 

## Usage 
The whenbot can be accessed at the url https://studio.whenhub.com/signin/?redirect_url=https://rtomrud.github.io/whenbot-app/. After logging in, simply use the chat input to type or speak using the microphone, and whenbot will carry out your orders. By asking whenbot for 'help', it will read the list of available commands.

## What is it?
The whenbot allows users to add, see, edit or delete their Whenhub schedules and events. Additionally, users can 'timeshift' a schedule, moving its events in time any arbitrary time amount, or to any particular date.

All the interaction is performed using natural language, and although there is a chat interface, it is designed so that users can speak to it and listen without having to look at the screen. This makes it ideal for situations where the user cannot use a computer screen, but still wants to check on his events, or make quick changes.
